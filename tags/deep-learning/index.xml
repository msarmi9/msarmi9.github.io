      <description>If you think neural nets are black boxes, you&amp;rsquo;re certainly not alone. While they may not be as interpretable as something like a random forest (at least not yet), we can still understand how they process data to arrive at their predictions. In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll do just that as we build our own network from scratch, starting with logistic regression.
This post is very much inspired by this fantastic post by Sylvain Gugger.</description>

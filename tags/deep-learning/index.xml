      <title>Making Sense of Attention</title>

      <description>When it comes to deep learning, few ideas have brought about such a radical shift in thinking as attention. Attention changed everything. Like other landmark ideas before it, attention draws merit from simplicity. If that reads like a typo to you, you&amp;rsquo;re not alone. In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll motivate attention as a natural way of looking at sequences and dig into three of the most common attention mechanisms you&amp;rsquo;ll encounter in the wild.</description>

      <title>Neural Nets Aren&#39;t Black Boxes</title>

      <description>If you think neural nets are black boxes, you&amp;rsquo;re certainly not alone. While they may not be as interpretable as something like a random forest (at least not yet), we can still understand how they process data to arrive at their predictions. In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll do just that as we build our own network from scratch, starting with logistic regression.
This post is very much inspired by this fantastic post by Sylvain Gugger.</description>
